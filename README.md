# Eight-Puzzle
For information on the 8-puzzle and its significance in introductory AI classes, see: http://www.cs.princeton.edu/courses/archive/spr10/cos226/assignments/8puzzle.html. Split into two directories, Java and MATLAB. The MATLAB folder is the implementation required for the class assignment. The Java directory is a planned visual implementation that solves the puzzle using the same process as the MATLAB version, but provides a graphic representation for kicks and giggles.
